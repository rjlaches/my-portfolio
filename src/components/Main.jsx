        <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p>
                <b>Motivated</b> and <b>driven</b> web developer with an eye for detail and a love for learning all things coding.
                I'm a strong team player who strives to understand every moving part of the task at hand. Cooperating and communicating
                with my peers in an effort to deploy high quality web solutions is what I do, and I take great pride in my work ethic. 
                Excited to learn from anyone willing to teach, and eager to help anyone with the drive to understand, I can be a valuable part
                of any development team. <br/>
                Born and raised in Apex, NC, and currently operating out of Wake County and the surrounding areas. I'm accessible via any remote platform
                as well as on site in the greater Raleigh area. In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends and family and take trips to the mountains and beaches of NC.
